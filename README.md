# Vehicle_classification_with_VGG16
Our project implements a Convolutional Neural Network, which is currently state-of-the-art in image recognition technologies. In our project, we use the primary structure of the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network, initially submitted for the ImageNet ILSVRC Challenge by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford.

Our project presents two approaches to vehicle classification using VGG-16; first, we use the weights of the pre-trained VGG-16 network submitted by the University of Oxford. Using transfer learning, our first implementation freezes the weights of VGG-16 layers with the original pre-trained weights (From the ILSVRC Submission). It connects it to a trainable, fully connected layer for classification. The fully connected layer is then trained on our dataset for classification. In our second approach, we build a VGG-16 Neural Network from scratch and train the entire network, from the convolutional layers to the fully connected layers on our specific dataset for the same classification. We then compare the accuracy and try to justify the results from the two approaches in our project
